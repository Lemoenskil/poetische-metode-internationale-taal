"There is one way to learn all languages. Karina has always known. While "
"studying Dutch she was introduced to the transformational generative grammar "
"of Noam Chomski. Much was expected at that time, they were on to something. "
"One could understand something of language, that which is completely our own "
"and yet completely mysterious. The transformational generative grammar "
"stated that everyone has an innate universal language ability. A foray from "
"language to physics, biology, humanity, pedagogy aroused curiosity. The "
"practice of the language learning process repeats itself a number of times "
"in life when one wants to learn a new language. Karina learned it well once, "
"French at the teacher academy and then made several attempts to learn other "
"languages. At the end of her teaching career she was introduced to "
"Esperanto. She was immediately charmed. So many beautiful words, sounds, a "
"simple grammar, without exceptions, free word order. After working through "
"some self-study methods, she started translating poems. These little "
"language gems of her own choosing continued to occupy her, so she mastered "
"the language. Eventually she came up with the idea of ​​putting some of them "
"together, providing them with a simple overview of the grammar, and thus the "
"'poetic language method' was born."
