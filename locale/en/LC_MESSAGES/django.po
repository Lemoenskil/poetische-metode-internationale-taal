"There is one way to learn all languages. Karina has always known. While "
"studying Dutch she was introduced to the transformational generative grammar "
"of Noam Chomski. Much was expected at that time, they were on to something. "
"One could understand something of language, that which is completely our own "
"and yet completely mysterious. The transformational generative grammar "
"stated that everyone has an innate universal language ability. A foray from "
"language to physics, biology, humanity, pedagogy aroused curiosity. The "
"practice of the language learning process repeats itself a number of times "
"in life when one wants to learn a new language. Karina learned it well once, "
"French at the teacher academy and then made several attempts to learn other "
"languages. At the end of her teaching career she was introduced to "
"Esperanto. She was immediately charmed. So many beautiful words, sounds, a "
"simple grammar, without exceptions, free word order. After working through "
"some self-study methods, she started translating poems. These little "
"language gems of her own choosing continued to occupy her, so she mastered "
"the language. Eventually she came up with the idea of ​​putting some of them "
"together, providing them with a simple overview of the grammar, and thus the "
"'poetic language method' was born."

"Esperanto is a language that can stand among all other languages. It is a "
"constructed international language which is also known as base language or "
"starter language. If one learns this language as a first foreign language, "
"learning other languages ​​is greatly facilitated.  A new language requires a "
"new method. In 2021 A Poetic Language Method was published by Humble Art, in "
"which 27 poems from 23 different European languages ​​are included, translated "
"and provided with information about the poet and a manual on how to use this "
"method.  The core of this is memorizing one poem per week, while learning "
"the new vocabulary in a playful way. The poetic method also teaches you how "
"to create word lists in your own way and use your own associations in the "
"language learning process. A brief overview of the language rules with "
"examples from the poems made it a brief introduction to the international "
"language.  On this website you will find a new poem every week with the "
"literal Esperanto translation next to it. Choose a poem that appeals to you "
"and focus on that one poem during that week.  About learning the language "
